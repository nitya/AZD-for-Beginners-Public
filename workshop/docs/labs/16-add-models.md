    In this hands-on lab, you will deploy Azure OpenAI models to your solution. You'll configure model endpoints, manage API keys, compare different models (GPT-4, GPT-4o, GPT-3.5), and set up fallback configurations. You'll learn how to optimize model selection based on cost, performance, and use case requirements.
