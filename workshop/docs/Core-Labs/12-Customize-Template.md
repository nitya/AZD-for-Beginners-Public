# 12. Customize: Template

Welcome to the customization chapter of your learning journey! This is where everything you've learned comes together in an exciting way.

By now, you've discovered how to find and select AZD templates, deployed a complete AI solution to Azure, and deconstructed the codebase to understand how all the pieces fit together. That's a significant achievement! Now comes the really fun part - making this template your own by customizing it to fit specific scenarios and unlocking powerful features that will take your AI application to the next level.

Think of this stage as moving into your new home and making it truly yours. The foundation is solid, the structure is sound, and now you get to add the personal touches and advanced features that make it perfect for your needs. Each customization you make will deepen your understanding of how AI applications work in production environments.
