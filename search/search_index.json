You can then make connections faster to other related tools or concepts in an intuitive way. Let's try this out!</p> <p>Analogy: Building an enterprise AI app is like building a new home and moving in!</p> <ol> <li>We need a general contractor - Instead of doing everything ourselves, we need an expert who can manage the resources and schedules, and execute the plan. This is the Azure Developer CLI (azd).</li> <li>We need a design blueprint - Instead of starting from scratch, we might pick a \"pre-fab\" design that suits our needs, and ask the contractor to use that as the basis to build on. This is your azd template.</li> <li>We need building materials - We need to decide what fixtures and utilities we want, and provide preferences to install and configure them correctly. This is your infrastructure-as-code <code>infra/</code> folder.</li> <li>We need interior design - We need to stage that home with furniture and other accessories to make it ready for real users to live in and interact. This is your application code (src/ folder).</li> <li>We need a construction plan - This outlines the tasks to be done by the contractor and the order in which to do them, to bring the design to life. This is your configuration file (azure.yaml)</li> <li>We need utility accounts and permits - These define key information (parameters and credentials) that homeowners need to know, to operate that home.  This is your .azure folder (with a <code>.env</code> file)</li> </ol> <p>As we go through the exercises, we'll try to refer to this analogy to give you a new frame of reference. Once you're done with the workshop, return to this section and ask yourself:</p> <ul> <li>Does this analogy still make sense? Is there a different analogy that might work for your learning style? </li> <li>What other connections can we make?
