One way to tackle a complex problem is to find a relevant analogy that can help you reframe issues or solutions in more familiar ways. Let's try this out.</p> <p>ANALOGY: BUILDING AI SOLUTIONS IS LIKE BUILDING A HOME</p> <ol> <li>I need a general contractor - Instead of doing everything myself, I need an expert who can manage the resources and schedules, and execute the plan. This is the Azure Developer CLI (azd).</li> <li>I need a design blueprint - Instead of starting from scratch, I want to look for a \"starter\" home design that I like and give that to my contractor as the basis to build on. This is your azd template.</li> <li>I need building materials - I need to decide what fixture and utilities I need and provide my preferences on how they should be installed and configured. This is your infrastrcture-as-code (infra/ folder).</li> <li>I need interior design - Once the house is in place, I need to decorate it with my things to provide the right user experience for my visitors. This is your application code (src/ folder).</li> <li>I need a build schedule - This is the construction plan and manifest showing me how the blueprint maps to the materials, and outlining the order in which things get done. This is your configuration file (azure.yaml)</li> <li>I need to store permits &amp; status - This is how I track the current state of my construction and keep information about various accounts for status checks. _This is your .azure folder (with a <code>.env</code> file)</li> </ol> <p>You can now make other connections. For instance:</p> <ol> <li>Starter templates are like starter homes. Use them to get familiar with maintenance.</li> <li>Template customization is like updating your current home to meet new requirements.</li> <li>Template discovery is like moving to a new home when your current one gets outdated.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"Resource-Guide/00/#23-deconstruct-to-learn","title":"2.3 Deconstruct To Learn","text":"<p>Now it's time to learn by doing.
