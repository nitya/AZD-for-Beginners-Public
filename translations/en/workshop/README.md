# AZD for AI Developers Workshop

Welcome to the hands-on workshop for learning Azure Developer CLI (AZD) with a focus on AI application deployment. This workshop helps you gain practical knowledge of AZD templates in 3 steps:

1. **Discovery** - find the template that suits your needs.
1. **Deployment** - deploy and ensure it works.
1. **Customization** - modify and adapt it to your requirements!

Throughout this workshop, you will also be introduced to essential developer tools and workflows to streamline your end-to-end development process.

<br/>

## Browser-Based Guide

The workshop lessons are written in Markdown. You can access them directly on GitHub or launch a browser-based preview as shown in the screenshot below.

![Workshop](../../../translated_images/workshop.75906f133e6f8ba07ab0302ce17f67ff90f357513f3d4c4bbafa5978b10f058b.en.png)

To use this option, fork the repository to your profile and launch GitHub Codespaces. Once the VS Code terminal is active, type this command:

```bash title="" linenums="0"
mkdocs serve > /dev/null 2>&1 &
```

In a few seconds, a pop-up dialog will appear. Select the option to `Open in browser`. The web-based guide will open in a new browser tab. Benefits of this preview include:

1. **Built-in search** - quickly find keywords or lessons.
1. **Copy icon** - hover over code blocks to see this option.
1. **Theme toggle** - switch between dark and light modes.
1. **Get help** - click the Discord icon in the footer to join!

## What You'll Learn

Think of the AZD Template as a sandbox for exploring various tools and capabilities for end-to-end development on Azure AI Foundry. By the end of this workshop, you should have a solid understanding of the tools and concepts in this context.

| Concept  | Objective |
|:---|:---|
| **Azure Developer CLI** | Learn tool commands and workflows|
| **AZD Templates**| Understand project structure and configuration|
| **Azure AI Agent**| Provision & deploy Azure AI Foundry projects  |
| **Azure AI Search**| Enable context engineering with agents |
| **Observability**| Explore tracing, monitoring, and evaluations |
| **Red Teaming**| Learn adversarial testing and mitigations |

<br/>
